 

Cumbrian Kayaking is a single page website, advertising camping and kayaking holidays in the Lake District national park in Cumbria in the UK. 



In exchange for their email  the user wants valuable information and assistance and then the company can ask their permission to add them to their marketing funnel . 

Website owners can supply some information immediately, and establish longer term communication with users Eg with off- season specials or group discounts.



## **## Goals of the website** 



The site has two goals 

#### ## 1. Goal of the Business Owner**

The business owners want to capture leads. They want to use the website to expand their business by attracting website visitors and converting them to customers via a marketing funnel .

 Converting a website viewer to a purchaser requires several communications with potential clients, purchasing is more likely if the company can persuade a user to part with their email address. 



**To meet this goal users are invited to opt-in using:**



 \1. **CTA -button in opening hero image** Button links to a name & email address request -

  in return the user receives a brochure with holiday details

 \2. ***\*Contact us form\**** - for users not yet ready for all the holiday details but who have a question about the holidays

 \3. ***\*Footer CTA button\****- a second opportunity to receive the brochure is located in the footer



The website will not meet the goal of the business owners unless it is able to persuade users to part with their emails - so it is equally important to meet the user/visitor goals



#### 2. The goals of the website user



A visitor scans the website quickly and make a decision -

Shall I book a holiday with this company ? 



 or more likely 



Is the information on this website sufficiently persuasive that I want more information about their holidays? If so - I am willing to exchange my email for their brochure or an answer to my question .



***\*The website attempts to meet the users goals\**** by providing 



 \1. Quick, easy and obvious navigation to access extra information ( CTA buttons, link to contact form with text area for questions.)

 \2. Images on the website aimed at instilling in the user an immediate sense of

 “ I would love to experience that “( hero image, images gallery)

 \3. Compelling, easy to read information on the website in terms of (features, team credentials)

 \4. Reassurance that their email will not be spammed

  \5. Evidence that the company is reputable by providing good social 

  proof with strong testimonials on the website and links to reputable

  holiday associations

   \6. Company phone number & email address - for users that don't want to

  give their email but are interested in contacting the company



It is hoped that a combination of these factors will promote the decision to ask for more details from the company 



### **## UX**



*******\*The website is for people\**** **



 \- Looking for activity holidays

 \- Interested in learning to kayak

 \- Or who want to improve their kayaking skills

## **## Features of the Website:** 

**Strategy**

The main function of the website is to persuade users that they will receive valuable information in exchange for giving their email to the company. By achieving the user goal, the goal of the business will also be met  and that is to collect the emails of users and add them to their marketing funnel to convert more viewers to buyers and expand the business. 

**Scope** 

The content and layout of the website is not to sell holidays but to establish a means for the company to maintain an ongoing connection with users of the website and eventually make them happy customers.

The company knows that it is important to communicate with interested users in the future - the capture of emails is vital to allow the business to give more information E.g. group specials and discounts and possibly convert the users to buyers. 

**Structure**  

The site is one page and the user will spend a very short time looking at the content -- every item on the site will be viewed for only a  few seconds- so every item must serve some function.  

**Skeleton**

- Desktop Version  [https://cacoo.com/diagrams/fHAOfsZez8Zom1Zi-F5A9F.png](https://cacoo.com/diagrams/fHAOfsZez8Zom1Zi-F5A9F.png)
- Tablet Version  [https://cacoo.com/diagrams/AqdhY7BO864hZIIr-D5861.png]( https://cacoo.com/diagrams/AqdhY7BO864hZIIr-D5861.png)
- Mobile Version https://cacoo.com/diagrams/Y6vIiZ5paBEQUSEc-A766A.png

**Surface** 

The appearance of the site is very important, if the site doesn't appear professional and established then the user is not likely to want to go further and become a client. The site is the shop- window for the company.

 They  may skip to another more interesting or more appealing offer.

 The images are carefully selected, text is presented in small palatable chunks that can be read quickly and the entire site can be scrolled in a few minutes.

Navigation is simple 

The user is given CTA instructions 

Testimonials are strong

User can see how to connect with the company quickly 

The requirements for user information are minimal. 











 \1. ***\*Navbar\****  with links to the different site sections 

Allows users to move around the site easily to find the information they need 

 Navbar is clear and easily read, and collapses to a convenient toggle menu icon on mobile

It is fixed and lets the user get back to top section or any other section by clicking the link 

Has a dropdown About Us to other sections of the site ( Reviews and Team information) 



 \2. An eyecatching ***\*jumbotron\**** section with large text and subheading 

Allows user to click and fill in a request for the brochure without scrolling through the page 

User sees exactly what to do and how with hardly any effort 



 \3. A ***\*hero image\****  

  Gives the user an immediate view of what their holiday might be like 

Draws their attention immediately to the information they can easily access



 \4. A **CTA button** leading to the **modal** with a simple email request form. 

Simple instructions, central location and minimal information requirement allows the user to get what they want quickly and easily

 Minimal requirement from the user to sign up just name and email 



 \5. A ***\*Features\**** section -- summarising activities available ,

Allows users to assess the main features of the holiday

  

 \6. A ***\*Team Member\**** section--

Allows user to read quickly about the team and if they want more information they can go to the individual social media pages for more details 



 \7. An ***\*Image Gallery\**** highlights the  most popular categories of kayaking trips

Allows the user to see types of holidays run by the company  

  

 \8. ***\*Social Proof\**** section featuring customer testimonials and links to 3rd party reviews from holiday organisations

Allows the user to read  the experiences of other customers and to see that the company is reputable



 \9. **A contact section ** again with minimal information to give 

Lets users make a query or  request speciifc information without getting a brochure 



 \10. ***\*Footer\**** --  supplies  links  to the company social media sites, gives phone and email of the company 

Allows users another opportunity to use a CTA button linking to the modal to get the holiday brochure  

 or to email the company directly or to call  





**## Features Left To Implement** 



\- ***\*Live Chat\**** so that users can ask questions and get them answered without delay

\- ***\*Remarketing pixels\**** so that the company can remind the visitor that they visited the site 

\- ***\*Videos\**** of wildlife and hiking trips and people around a campfire -- to add to the virtual experience

\- ***\*SEO features\**** - adding meta data & descriptions as well as G -maps and locations to enable search engines to find the website in response to user search queries  

\- ***\*A carousel\**** to replace the static image trip section and another carousel for additional testimonials

\- ***\*A message bot\**** to answer routine questions and take enquiries and numbers for call backs.

\- ***\*Video testimonials\**** from clients filmed during their holiday.

\- ***\*Photoshopping the hero image\**** to achieve better text readability - I tried several different ways to make the text stand out, including making the transparent jumbotron a contrasting underlay but it looked ugly. For the time being I darkened the area with a tool in Canva.com but it is still not exactly right and it is not correct in mobile view -- because I  cropped parts of the image and added them back - it needs more work. 

**Links to 3rd party tourist organisations** such as Trip Advisor , Expedia etc -- I did not have time to add 

**Add an alert** at the top of the website - I was going to add but did not have time 



**## Technologies Used**



\- [Cacoo.com](https://cacoo.com) - to create a mockup of the different versions of the website, desktop, tablet & mobile 

\- [Typora](https://typora.com)- to create the README.md file to outline the site creation process 

\- [HTML]( https://html.com)  **Hypertext Markup Language**  the project uses HTML to write the standard markup language that allows the document to   to be displayed in a web browser.

[ CSS]()  **Cascading Style Sheets** is the style sheet language used in this project for describing the presentation of the document written in HTML 

[JavaScrip](https://www.javascript.com/)t a Java Script  cdn script was added as part of the Bootstrap scripts. In the website it allows  the toggle menu icon   to work correctly as used in the mobile view of the website. 

[JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

[Canva.com](https://Canva.com ) for cropping images and attempting to darken the hero image for text contrast.

[formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)  for connecting the forms to make them work 

[Formatting](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html ) the code     Gitpod formatter does not work for me, so I copy pasted my code into this free website and replaced it.



## ## Testing



\- **Chrome developer tools** --on the Chrome browser was used constantly  during development to add styles to conveniently try changes immediately and to check basic layout of the website and to check site responsiveness on different screen sizes 

**Mozilla developer tools-** used particularly to assess the site  for accessibility in terms of text visibility ( contrast)

[https://validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org ) / used to check code HTML for  coding errors such as open tags and errors in classes etc. 

[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Used to check CSS code for errors 

[https://Caniuse.com](https://Caniuse.com ) to check if features of the site are accessible on a browser



**Testing  Display** 

Chrome developer tools  used to check  elements in different  views 

Went through each section and tested and altered display based on what looked better 



**Navbar Links** connect to correct website section  - tested and  work 

**Dropdown links** appear can ,be clicked and go to correct section -tested and work 

**CTA buttons** in hero section and footer  work and open modal 

Show pointer, change color on hover and show state change after use

**Modal** opens  if incorrect data is  entered an error message appears 

**Submit buttons** in modal and in Contact form change state on clicking 

**Social link buttons** in Team section and Footer change state & have hover and pointer

**Social media link  buttons** work and connect to correct social site

 **Contact form** works   shows change in state 

Error message shows if  email not correct , if name not entered , text in textarea works 



 **Accessibility**

- Used  HTML5 semantic elements title,  nav, footer, form, header, button, jumbotron  to clarify elements for screen readers, search engines & developers

- Used mozilla developer tools   to check readibility of text in terms of contrast 

- Used rems not px to allow user to zoom browser view. 

- Used screen reader labels on buttons and aria labels for screen readers to identify elements

- Used alt tags to describe images in case browser can't load and for SEO purposes. 

- Used simple text font for visibility










**###### Layout of the site in different versions** 

Because  of the numbers of individual elements ( images reviews etc ) 

It was necessary to  control the displayed in different versions  

Final versions are:

**Desk top** -- all elements displayed 2 rows of 3 images, 3 feature cards, 3 team members, 4 reviews 

**Tablet**  --  display is  2 rows of 2  images, 2 feature cards, 2 team members, and 2 rows of  2 reviews 

**Mobile** display  4  gallery images, 3 feature cards ,2 team members and 2 reviews 

**Changes to display**

Initially I had only  2 reviews in  the <u>tablet</u> view, I changed the display to display 2 rows of 2 

I altered  the hidden at 768 px width  with hidden at smaller viewpoint - sm & xs (576px) 

This didn’t change the display on mobile view at 320px but improved the tablet view

**## Problems with website** 



Navbar looked too crowed with 6 links ( home, contact, features, team, reviews, gallery )

**Fix** - used a dropdown to move team and reviews links and named the dropdown About

Decided that Image gallery doesn't need a link 



Testing different views revealed a problem of gapping on the RHS especially in mobile view

**Tried to fix** on my own -- adding overflow hidden, removing margins & padding  etc. looking for answers

 **Fix** asked the tutors for help and Samantha said she thought it might be to do with the navbar

When I removed the .fixed-top  the gap improved 

But  the fixed- top navbar  is necessary so that the user can navigate to sections easily 

 I tried substituting sticky- top to a new class  and did not work. 

I restored the fixed- top navbar and added overflow hidden CSS code to the navbar section 



Smaller white text  is not clear  on  the hero image -Tried to fix by adding a dark overlay the text is not 100% clear because there is light reflection on the water. 

**Tried to fix** by

 adding a dark overlay

 Made the jumbotron background darker but it looked ugly 

Darkened some areas using a tool from Canva.com

Still not perfect can be an update at a later date



**Main image** caused a scroll- bar at the bottom of the container 

 **Fix** removed by adding overflow hidden, code to CSS



**Display**  of the  feature cards  I wanted one row of 2 cards to show in tablet ( smaller than 1024px )

and they showed as one row of 2 and one row of one underneath 

Fixed with  help of the bootstrap display information -- now show as one row of 2 from 990-  425px and then go to one column of 3 stacked in mobile at screens smaller than 425px

**Image gallery section** - I added a carousel but it conflicted with the contact form and skewed it . After spending time trying to fix without a good result, I decided it was better to go with static images for now 

**Gallery images** were difficult to position but improved when I  cropped to uniform size 

**Contact section** - stretched too much in mobile view -- fixed by adding media query to add width 

**No social links** were showing and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why - tutors pointed out no connection to fontawesome.com because I had not uploaded 

Day before submission was due -- site had looked good with last mentor session, on opening the browser the following morning the last 2 sections had jumped up to the middle of the site -- I tried to get help from the tutors and they did their best but they had to pass me to other people. 

 **Fix** A large part of the problem was that I had opened git pod from the green button and created loads of different versions.  Then I went back with a tutor and opened an earlier version but then I didn't know how to merge the later one and could not git push it.  I spent the following day restoring the site and I am happy with the way it is now but a couple of days late. 

Another bad problem occurred when the features section suddenly blew up and only showed the icons at 100 times their normal size --

**Fix**  I tried  to retrace what I was doing to  find the problem ,then fed the code into a validator and discovered a stray curly bracket was essentially commenting out all the css for the section. 

**Wireframes** -- My Balsamiq.com subscription expired and the license key given in Slack is not accepted so the wireframes that I made at the start of the project cannot be exported or used. 

 **Fix** I used a good substitute at the last minute  Cacoo.com and will have to pay a subscription to use it and have accessible links.

The original  wireframe used for the project is  represented in the finished site -- the only item missing is the 3rd party links to the tourist organisations.
