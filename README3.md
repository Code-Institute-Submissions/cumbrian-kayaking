 Cumbrian Kayaking is a single page website,  advertising camping and kayaking  holidays in the  Lake District national park in Cumbria in the UK.  



## Goals of the website 

The site has two goals 


 1. 

## Business Owners

The business owners want to capture leads. They want to use the website to expand their business by attracting website visitors and converting them to customers  via a marketing funnel .

 **To meet this goal
  users are invited to opt-in using:**

a) ** Hero CTA -button** Button links to a name &  email address request - in return the user receives a brochure with holiday details

b)   **Contact us form** -  for users not  yet ready for all the holiday details  but who have a question about the holidays

c)  **Footer CTA button ** a second opportunity to get  the brochure is located  in the footer

c) ** Company phone number & email address**  are in the navbar and in the footer giving  other contact options.

 Converting a website viewer to a  purchaser requires several  communications with potential clients, this is facilita 

 Users are offered valuable information and assistance via their email, and then the company is given their permission to add their email in their marketing   funnel . Website owners can supply some information immediately, and establish longer term communication with users Eg  with off- season specials or group discounts.

####   **The goal of  the website user**

To scan the  website quickly and make a decision -
That decision might be- shall I book a holiday with this company but it is more likely to be- 

Am I sufficiently persuaded by the information on this website that I am willing to exchange my  email for  more information about the holidays? - either an answer to my question or to receive their brochure with all the details.

Most  users know  that when they give their email to a company they will be added to their marketing list  so the primary function of the website must be to  convince the user that they will receive value in exchange for their email   

**The website attempts to meet the users goals by**

a) Easy, obvious navigation to  access more information  - CTA button, Contact us link, contact form with text area for messages 

b)  Images on the website  aimed at  instilling in the user an immediate sense of “ I would love to experience that “- hero image, trips gallery 

 c) Compelling easy to read information on the website in terms of -  features,  team credentials.

 d)  Reassurance  that their email will not be spammed and that the company is credible by providing  good social proof with strong testimonials on the website and links to reputable holiday associations



It is hoped that a combination of these factors will  promote the decision to ask for more details from the company 





## UX

**The website is for people** who are interested in  activity holidays, who want to learn how to kayak or want to improve their kayaking skills and  want short outdoor breaks in a beautiful setting.

Users are deciding  ( quickly ) whether they are sufficiently interested to ask for more details.

Users might want the website to provide them with

1. General information immediately Eg 

A summary of  main features of the holidays

Visual examples of holiday types

The qualifications of the kayak instructors 

Social proof of the credibility of the company from 3rd party reviews

Strong social proof that other people  were happy with their experience.

2.  Extra  information  from the company ( other than that on the website) Eg 

To get answers to their questions 

To  receive detailed information about prices, availability, deposits etc.



UX section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features  

·     Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

An Alert 

A **navbar** (collapses to a convenient menu icon on mobile),  links to the different site sections 

An eyecatching  **jumbotron** section with large text and sub heading and a central CTA  button for the viewer to sign up for the holiday brochure -- this is the first thing the viewer will see 

A **hero image** represents the experience for users and  calls their attention immediately to the  detailed holiday information they can easily access

A **modal** that opens to a simple form  -- this allows the user to get what they want in a matter of a few minutes without having to go any further.  

A **Features** section -- summarising activities available , accommodation and food options 

A **Team Member**  section-- highlighting the experience and qualifications  of the team including their safety qualifications

**Footer** -- with links to social sites and another link to receive the brochure



## Features Left To Implement 

- **Live Chat** so that users can ask questions and get them answered without delay
- **Remarketing pixels** so that the company can remind the visitor that they visited the site 
- **Videos** of wildlife and hiking trips and people around a campfire -- to add to the virtual experience
- **SEO features**  - adding  meta data & descriptions as well as G -maps and locations to enable search engines to find the website in response to user search queries   
- **A  carousel** to replace the static image trip section 
-  **A message bot**  to answer routine questions and take enquiries and numbers for call backs.
- **Video testimonials** from clients  filmed during their holiday.
- Change the hero image to achieve better text readability - I tried several different ways to make the text stand out, including making the transparent jumbotron a contrasting underlay but it looked ugly. For the time being I darkened the area with a tool in Canva.com but  it is still not exactly right.

## Problems with website 

Added alert to clarify users can get brochure and they can use contact form to ask a question

Navbar looked too crowed with 6 links ( home, contact, features, team, reviews, gallery  )

Fix - used a dropdown to move team and reviews links and named the dropdown About

Image gallery doesn't need a link 



The hero image - even after adding a dark overlay the jumbotron text is not 100%  clear 

I made the jumbotron background darker but it looked ugly 

I darkened some areas using a tool from Canva.com but really needs photoshop ( I don't have)

Image caused a scroll- bar at the bottom of the container -- I removed by adding code to CSS

Features section -- problem gapping on the RHS of the container - I removed by adding css to the body 

Cards position not aligned -- I fixed using 

Image gallery section - I added a carousel but it conflicted with the contact form and skewed it .  After spending time trying to fix without a good result, I decided  it was better to go with static images for now 

Gallery images all had to be cropped to uniform size I discovered. 

I could not make the frames for round images for the team members. - for now I cannot add them. the code I have from love running does not work. 

Contact section - stretched too much in mobile view -- fixed by adding media query to add width
